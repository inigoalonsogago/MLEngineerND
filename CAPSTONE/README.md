# Capstone Project
The capstone project build a sentiment classifier of movie reviews using the MUSE cross-lingual embeddings created by developpers at Facebook

## Notes
* The file train_model trains the LSTM and saves the weights of the model. It has the preprocessing of the Spanish dataset commented as the aligment vectors where already saved in the datasets file.

* Overall_Analysis contains the error analysis of the model as well as the previous steps but the training of the model (the weights are loaded). It shows the accruacy of the sentiment analysis over Spanish movie reviews. Again, the preprocessing of the Spanish dataset is commented.

* the datasets that should go on the datasets folder, can be found on the following google drive link:
