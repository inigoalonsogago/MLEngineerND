# Boston Housing Pricing Project
This project builds a regression model to predict the prices of the houses in Boston. It considers 51 diferent variables for this purpose
##Problem Overview
The Boston housing market is highly competitive, and we want to be the best real estate agent in the area. To compete with our peers, we decide to leverage a few basic machine learning concepts to assist us and a client with finding the best selling price for their home. Luckily, weâ€™ve come across the Boston Housing dataset which contains aggregated data on various features for houses in Greater Boston communities, including the median value of homes for each of those areas. Our task is to build an optimal model based on a statistical analysis with the tools available. This model will then be used to estimate the best selling price for our clients' homes.
