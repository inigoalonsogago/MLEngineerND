# Dog Breed Classifier
Implementation of deep convolutional neural networks for dog breed classifcation.
Transfer learning from various trained state of the art deep networks is applied.

## Goal
Given an image of a dog, the algorithm identifies an estimate of the canineâ€™s breed. If supplied an image of a human, the code identifies the resembling dog breed.
